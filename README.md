Repository for Berkeley ML/AI program

Includes Module 11 prompt for analysis on used vehicle data
Summary:
* Includes linear regression analysis on dataset provided by program aligned with industry standard evaluation features to determine what drives used vehicle pricing
* Make, model, year and odometer readings were assumed to be the primary drivers and evaluated on a subset of top vehicle models.  Secondary feature of title status was included with no apparent material impact to valuation based on analysis of top model subset
* Recommendation is to evaluate other pricing models and/or features at the vehicle model level to better understand high value features
